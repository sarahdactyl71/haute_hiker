## Haute Hiker

This is currently a WIP for a small passion project of mine. Built with Python/Django,
this project is intended to catalog, rate, and write about all sorts of dehydrated backpacking food. 

### Why Backpacking Food?

I am a foodie, always have been. I also fancy my self a weekend warrior, with a love of nature. I will also admit that when I have hiked 15 miles with significant gains and loss in elevation, that dehydrated chili mac is just as appealing as whatever duck confit special the french bistro was serving. 

Even so, I have had backpacking meals that I have eaten well knowing that I would throw a brick through the window if this was served to me in a restaurant (just kidding, I am a millenial and I just say nothing). However, I have also had some pretty decent food out there, and I love the idea of living it up as much as you can while enjoying the scenery of nature.

I hope to be silly, informative, and down to earth with this. If someone out there went looking to me for a recommendation I will know that I have succeeded.
